# Double Stop Validator
This MuseScore 4 pluin tells you if your selected chord is playable on the instrument (works for violin/viola/cello/double bass). If a chord is unplayable, it will tell you the measure number, the time, and the instrument that is playing the chord.  
If there are no issues detected, it will say "All good." Otherwise, it will list all unplayable chords.  
In the popup box, hovering over an item in the list will (usually) highlight the chord on the score.  
  
A few notes:  
- The Double Stop Validator cannot tell how difficult a chord is to play, only if it's possible or not.  
- The plugin works on triple and quadruple stops as well as double stops.  
- The plugin is not perfect; it uses positions and fingers to determine whether the chord is playable. As such, its results should be taken with a grain of salt.  
- It is recommended to set the plugin to a shortcut (Plugins > Manage Plugins... > Double Stop Validator > Edit shortcut > double click on the item).
